# supr-portal

This directory is the password change portal.
Navigating to a URL at the IPA web interface
first directs the user to SUPR web pages
where he can enter his SUPR credentials.

After successful verification the user is presented
with a web page, where he can set a password
for himself at the IPA server.

This is the top level directory.

Folders in this directory are as follows.

`files` is a collection of either additional or
changed files scatterd all over in the OS and
and the IPA server directories which will implement
the functionality for the SUPR proxy authentication
and the IPA password change.

`doc` is a directory which contains developer documentation.
  
`dist` is a directory with the release tarballs.
