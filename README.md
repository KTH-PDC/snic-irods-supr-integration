# snic-irods-supr-integration

This is SNIC iRODS SUPR integration, a collection of
scripts to synchromize and update user and project
information between SUPR, the Swestore LDAP and the
iRODS IPA server.

There is an extension/modification to the IPA server to
create a password change portal which enables users to
change their passwords in IPA, after having their credentials
verified by SUPR.
